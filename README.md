# Why is this article interesting? 
I found Joel Spolsky’s article interesting because when I think of software engineering, I don’t usually think of English reading and writing as the most important skills. I tend to think the key is understanding and using different technologies. However, after reflecting more deeply, I can see why strong communication matters. In my opinion, it’s important not only for writing specifications, but also because using technology effectively requires being able to read and understand documentation.

Another point that stood out to me was GPA. Many people say GPA never matters, but Spolsky’s perspective suggests that a very low GPA can lead to getting screened out before a recruiter even looks at the courses you took. That seems especially relevant because some students may have taken easier classes instead of more demanding CS courses like Operating Systems.
